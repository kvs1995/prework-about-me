      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a Technical Analyst aspiring to get into Web Development. I learned Python as a first language and now primarily use SQL for my work.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>All over the place! I was born San Diego, moved to Houston, Chicago, Iowa City, and am now back in Chicago!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love drawing, painting and am in the middle of an attempt to teach myself piano. I love concerts and a good Chicago Blackhawks hockey game! I am also constantly traveling now, taking advantage of the remote work from home since I do not have to take PTO if I time my flights accordingly. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Animation or video game design would be an amazing mix of technical and creative skills.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Wrigleyville</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been intrigued by other languages outside of SQL and I think web development is a great mix of incorporating creative aspects into my work. I'm excited to expand my coding repertoire and see what doors having this skill set will open for me.</p>
